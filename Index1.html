<p>Fuchka is an integral part of Bengali street-food culture. No hangout is ever complete without an appetizing plate of this delicious Bangladeshi food. Fuchka is a beloved and ubiquitous snack in South Asia, with regional variations in the fillings and dipping sauces used. It is often sold by street vendors or in small snack shops, and is a popular choice for an afternoon or evening snack. It is also considered a social food, as it is often shared and enjoyed with friends and family in a communal setting.</p>
